## Creating JavaScript Environment

> More upgraded : Use https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/

#### Editor

Visual Studio Code, Aptana, Eclipse etcetera. Personally I love sublime text 3 and 

Prefer an editor which has built-in features of IntelliSense support and syntax error highlighter for speedy development.

#### Online Editor

You can also use online editor to learn JavaScript e.g. repl.it, plnkr.co, jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com.
